FIX Proxy

!!! EXPERIMENTAL !!!

This project is the source for the roq-fix-proxy package.

All FIX business logic has been moved into the roq-fix library allowing us to fully separate the network layer.

Note! The roq-fix-proxy-2 package is the legacy implementation of the proxy where business logic was mixed with the network layer.
